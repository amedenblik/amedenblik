### 👋 Hello, I'm Andrea!

I am a Hydrologist at the [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)](https://usgs.gov/) - [Web Informatics & Mapping (WIM)](https://wim.usgs.gov/) team. I develop software that supports USGS water science initiatives.

- 👩‍💻 I primarily work on [StreamStats](http://streamstats.usgs.gov/): the main StreamStats client is a web-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application that provides users with access to analytical tools that are useful for water-resources planning, management, engineering, and design purposes. The StreamStats ecosystem includes multiple clients, services, and databases. 
- 🌊 I also work on [WaveLab](https://www.usgs.gov/software/wavelab): Python-based application that calculates storm-tide water level and wave statistics for deployed instrument data.
- 💬 Ask me about WIM projects, geospatial analysis, watershed hydrology, data visualization, web development
- ⚙ Frameworks I use: Angular, AngularJS, Vue.js, FastAPI, .NET Core
- ❗ Please note: WIM software repositories have moved from GitHub to the [USGS Official Source Code Archive](https://code.usgs.gov/) and may not be publicily accessible until released as provisional or approved software.
